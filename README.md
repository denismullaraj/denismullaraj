## Hey 👋  

I'm **Denis**, a **Senior iOS Engineer** based in **Milan, Italy**. 
I’ve been building apps for Apple platforms since **2018** with a focus on **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, and **performance optimization**. Prior to iOS, I worked in **Android development** (Java/Kotlin) from **2015 to 2018**.

### 🚀 A Look at My Work  
- 🚗 **[DriveSafe iOS](https://github.com/denismullaraj/drivesafe-ios)** — Originally developed in **2018** using **UIKit & ARKit**, recently rewritten with **SwiftUI** for a modern touch.  
- 🏆 **[Swift iOS Quiz](https://github.com/denismullaraj/swift-ios-quiz)** — Built in **2019**, this project won a **Telegram Educational Test Contest** and is now open-sourced.  
- 💡 Over the years, I’ve contributed to **Productivity, Dating, Banking & Airline industries**, shipping 20+ high-quality iOS & macOS apps.  

I love **empowering others to be self-sufficient**, offering my expertise where it makes the biggest impact.
